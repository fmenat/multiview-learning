## Examples
* [Example on how to define and use different fusion strategies in the MVL model](./examples/different_fusion_strategies.ipynb)
* [Example on how to train these MVL models](./examples/train_examples.ipynb)

For definitions on the concepts used here please look at [Common Practices and Taxonomy in Deep Multiview Fusion for Remote Sensing Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418966).


## Install

* For installation you can run:
```python
pip install --editable .
```
